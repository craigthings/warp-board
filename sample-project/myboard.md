# Sample Documentation

Welcome to the sample documentation project for Warp Board! This demonstrates the core features of the hierarchical markdown board system.

---

## About This Project

This sample project shows how Warp Board organizes documentation spatially. Each card on the right represents a document, and clicking a card will drill down into its content and sub-cards.

## Key Concepts

- **Cards** represent markdown documents
- **Connections** show relationships between topics
- **Drill-down** navigation lets you explore nested content
- All content is stored as plain markdown and JSON files

## Getting Started

Double-click any card on the right to navigate into it!
